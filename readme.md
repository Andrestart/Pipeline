This project is about taking data from an API and a dataset to analyse them and get to conclusions from different hypotheses.<br />

I have used AEMET api and https://datos.madrid.es/ to collect my data.<br />

The data I have studied are:<br />
    - Rainfall (in mm/m2) in Madrid during 2020 (as collected by the weather station in the Retiro Park).<br />
    - Number of accidents in Madrid during 2020.<br />
    - Evolution of both along the year.<br />

Follow this process to create the new dataframes and be able to visualize them in graphs:<br />
    1. Run "main.py" file using visual code or other code editor.<br />
    2. You will notice that a new folder named "new_dataframes" have been created and contains 3 new files.<br />
    3. Open the file "graphs.ipynb" using Jupyter Notebook.<br />
    4. Click on kernel/Restart and Run All. This will create the graphs taken from the new dataframes<br />
    5. Read the description of every graph to read about the analysis.<br />

The conclusions of my project are:<br />
    - The number of accidents per day and ranfall are not correlated in 2020.<br />
    - The most repeated rain pattern is no rain. <br />
    - There is a very significant drop in the number of accidents per day since March 14th, corresponding with the covid lockdown measures happened that exact day.<br />
