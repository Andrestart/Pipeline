This project is about taking data from an API and a dataset to analyse them and get to conclusions from different hypotheses.

I have used AEMET api and https://datos.madrid.es/ to collect my data.

The data I have studied are:
    - Rainfall (in mm/m2) in Madrid during 2020 (as collected by the weather station in the Retiro Park).
    - Number of accidents in Madrid during 2020.
    - Evolution of both along the year.

The conclusions of my project are:
    - The number of accidents per day and ranfall are not correlated in 2020.
    - The most repeated rain pattern is no rain.
    - There is a very significant drop in the number of accidents per day since March 14th, corresponding with the covid lockdown measures happened that exact day.
